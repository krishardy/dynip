* Provide config file from command line when starting client
* service/init.d service management
* RPM and DEB packaging (purely for my experience)
* Android client
* Encrypted packet data to prevent snooping
* Flood prevention - Packet receipt throttling
* Flood prevention - Only accept packets from white-listed clients?
* Flood prevention - Database back-end or smarter file parsing (purely to control memory consumption in the case of LOTS of clients)
* Flood prevention - Keying or Signing of packets
* Admin UI (is this *really* needed???)  (Maybe cmd2 would be a good stopgap if a wizard is needed)
